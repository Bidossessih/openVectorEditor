###Trying out webpack

To use this repo:
clone it,

	git clone https://github.com/tnrich/webpackTrial.git

Then, get the dependencies by running

	npm install

	npm install -g webpack 
	
	npm install -g webpack-dev-server

For the first run, you need to build the bundle by running:

	webpack

after that, you can run 

	npm run dev

to start the development server with live-reload
